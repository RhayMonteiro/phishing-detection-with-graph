Detection of Malicious Sites using Graph Machine Learning

This work proposes an approach to detect phishing, 
evaluating the structure of the graph from the connection of sites 
to extract features from the graph, 
in addition to the features commonly used in the literature such as features of URL and SSL certificate. 
We evaluate the impact of the use of graph features compared to existing features in the literature, 
from the point of view of machine learning metrics and of computational time required. 
The obtained results suggest that graph machine learning can be used effectively in phishing detection.
